        ----------
        estimator : estimator instance
            The estimator calling this callback hook.

        data : dict
            Dictionary containing the training and validation data. The possible
            keys are "X_train", "y_train", "sample_weight_train", "X_val", "y_val"

        """Method called at the end of each task of the estimator.

        Parameters
        ----------
        estimator : estimator instance
            The estimator calling this callback hook. It might differ from the estimator
            passed to the `on_fit_begin` method for auto-propagated callbacks.

        task_info : dict
            Property :meth:`~sklearn.callback.CallbackContext.task_info` from the caller
            callback context.

        **kwargs : dict
            arguments passed to the callback. Possible keys are

            - data: dict
                Dictionary containing the training and validation data. The keys are
                "X_train", "y_train", "sample_weight_train", "X_val", "y_val",
                "sample_weight_val". The values are the corresponding data. If a key is
                missing, the corresponding value is None.

            - stopping_criterion: float
                Usually iterations stop when `stopping_criterion <= tol`.
                This is only provided at the innermost level of iterations.

            - tol: float
                Tolerance for the stopping criterion.
                This is only provided at the innermost level of iterations.

            - from_reconstruction_attributes: estimator instance
                A ready to predict, transform, etc ... estimator as if the fit stopped
                at this node. Usually it's a copy of the caller estimator with the
                necessary attributes set but it can sometimes be an instance of another
                class (e.g. LogisticRegressionCV -> LogisticRegression)

            - fit_state: dict
                Model specific quantities updated during fit. This is not meant to be
                used by generic callbacks but by a callback designed for a specific
                estimator instead.

        Returns
        -------
        stop : bool
            Whether or not to stop the current level of iterations at this task node.

        ----------
        estimator : estimator instance

        task_info : dict
            Property :meth:`~sklearn.callback.CallbackContext.task_info` from the caller
            callback context corresponding to the whole `fit` task. This is usually the
            root of the task tree of the estimator but it can be an intermediate node if
            the estimator is a sub-estimator of a meta-estimator.
